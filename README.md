:smiley: Hi there, I'm Jaylen! I've been learning iOS Developement for a year now; mostly in SwiftUI. I am also knowledgable in UiKit and Storyboards! Outside of iOS, I have made it my goal to learn other programming languages. Here's my experiences

- :iphone: Swift and SwiftUI (1 year, 2 months)
- :coffee: Java (10 months) 
- :snake: Python (6-7 months) 
- :eye: C (2-3 months) 

Outside of programming, I run a small YouTube channel where I talk about cars, technology, and gaming.
