:smiley: Hi there, I'm Jaylen! I've been learning iOS Developement for a year now (Mostly in SwiftUI). I am also knowledgable in UiKit and Storyboards! Outside of iOS Development, I have made it my goal to learn other programming languages. Here's my experiences

- :iphone: Swift and SwiftUI (1 year, 2 months)
- :crayon: UiKit (6 months)
- :coffee: Java (10 months) 
- :snake: Python (6-7 months) 

Outside of programming, I run two small YouTube channels: one about technology and second one around programming!

- :camera: YouTube #1: [MainKo](https://youtube.com/channel/UCcCKGhjb8yXFmeTmHuthhNw)
- :camera: YouTube #2: [codingKo](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCdyzflW8voWbWwrEhO6ZXzw)

ANDD outside of the internet and tech world, I enjoy:
- :roller_skate: Roller skating
- :running: Going for runs
- :video_game: Video games with friends
- :earth_americas: Exploring the world
- :film_strip: Movies, movies, and MORE movies!

Within my GitHub, I attempt to learn or practice with code, frameworks, and/or APIs. I learn something new everyday with programming and hopefully I am able to demonstrate that with each project I upload on here. 

Thank you for checking out my GitHub!
